### Installation

Compatible with Laravel Nova 4 and 5.

```bash
composer require dillingham/nova-attach-many
```

### Usage

```php
use NovaAttachMany\AttachMany;
```
```php
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        AttachMany::make('Permissions'),
    ];
}
```

You can explicitly define the relationship & Nova resource:

```php
AttachMany::make('Field Name', 'relationshipName', RelatedResource::class);
```

### Display on detail:

This package only provides the create / edit views that BelongsToMany does not.

BelongsToMany should be used for displaying the table on detail views.

```php
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        AttachMany::make('Permissions'),
        BelongsToMany::make('Permissions'),
    ];
}
```

### Validation

You can set min, max, size or custom rule objects

```php
->rules('min:5', 'max:10', 'size:10', new CustomRule)
```

### Exclusive Items

You can specify a list of IDs that, if selected, will make the selection exclusiveâ€”no other items can be selected at the same time. This is useful for options like "None" or "Unlimited" that should not be combined with other selections.

**How to use:**

```php
AttachMany::make('Permissions')
    ->exclusiveItems([1, 2, 3]);
```

- If an exclusive item is selected, all other selections are cleared and only the exclusive item remains selected.
- If any exclusive item is selected, all other checkboxes are disabled.
- If a non-exclusive item is selected, exclusive items become disabled.
- The UI shows a small message next to disabled checkboxes to clarify why they are disabled.

You can pass any array of IDs (integers or strings) to `exclusiveItems()`.

### Options

Here are a few customization options

- `->showCounts()` Shows "selected/total"
- `->showPreview()` Shows only selected
- `->hideToolbar()` Removes search & select all
- `->height('500px')` Set custom height
- `->fullWidth()` Set to full width
- `->showRefresh()` Request the resources again
- `->showSubtitle()` Show the resource's subtitle
- `->help('<b>Tip:</b> help text')` Set the help text
- `->exclusiveItems([1,2,3])` Make listed IDs exclusive: if one is selected, no others can be selected at the same time

### All Options Demo

### Relatable
The attachable resources will be filtered by relatableQuery()
So you can filter which resources are able to be attached

### Being Notified of Changes

You can add a method to the resource to be notified of the changes that have happened:

The method must be a camel cased version of the attribute name, followed by `Synced`. For example:

```php
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        AttachMany::make('Permissions'),
    ];
}
```

```php
public function permissionsSynced(array $changes)
{
    $changes['attached']; // An array of IDs of attached models
    $changes['detached']; // An array of IDs of detached models
    $changes['updated']; // An array of IDs of updated models
}
```


### Authorization
This field also respects policies: ie Role / Permission
- RolePolicy: attachAnyPermission($user, $role)
- RolePolicy: attachPermission($user, $role, $permission)
- PermissionPolicy: viewAny($user)
